\usage{
loadResSim(
  file,
  wide = TRUE,
  elevsheet = NULL,
  outflowsheet = NULL,
  powerhousesheet = NULL,
  rosheet = NULL,
  spillsheet = NULL,
  year_override = FALSE,
  forced_year_range = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character string indicating the full file path to an
Excel workbook of HEC-ResSim flow outputs. Each of the following worksheets
must be present (\code{*} indicates a prefix that will be ignored when the file
is read in): \verb{*_ELEV}: elevation of the pool in feet; \verb{*_OUT}:
total outflow in cubic feet per second (CFS); \verb{*_PH}: flow through the
powerhouse turbines (total) in CFS; \verb{*_RO}: flow through the regulating
outlet in CFS; \verb{*_SPILL}: flow through the spillway in CFS. In each sheet,
there should be one column for each year in the period of record and one
row for each day in the year.}

\item{wide}{Are data in wide format (e.g., year across columns, one row for each
day in the 365-day year, Feb 29 in leap years are ignored)? Defaults to TRUE,
following standard input format of Res-Sim spreadsheets.}

\item{elevsheet}{Name of Excel sheet containing ResSim results for pool
elevation. If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL} and the function will use th
first sheet ending in "-"}

\item{outflowsheet}{Name of Excel sheet containing ResSim results for flow
through all outlets for each day in the period of record. If not provided,
defaults to \code{NULL} and the function will use the first sheet ending in "-out"}

\item{powerhousesheet}{Name of Excel sheet containing ResSim results for flow
through the powerhouse route. If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL} and the
function will use the first sheet ending in "-ph"}

\item{rosheet}{Name of Excel sheet containing ResSim results for flow
through the regulating outlet route. If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL} and
the function will use the first sheet ending in "-ro"}

\item{spillsheet}{Name of Excel sheet containing ResSim results for flow
through the spillway route. If not provided, defaults to \code{NULL} and
the function will use the first sheet ending in "-spill"}

\item{year_override}{Useful for debugging; should mismatches in years be
overridden by the script? This forces the years to match the defined period
of record defined in \code{forced_year_range}. Defaults to FALSE, such that errors are returned
when there are year mismatches.}

\item{forced_year_range}{If a vector of years is provided here, override the years in the period of record.
All ResSim and other FBW inputs that do not conform to the period of record are forced to have this span.}
