Description: The Fish Benefits Workbook (FBW) is a simulation model that uses a 
  series of calculations to estimate how dam structures, operations, and 
  hydrology impact downstream survival of fish passing dams. It was developed
  from an Excel Workbook, the Fish Benefits Workbook, into R for the sake  of 
  expanding the model and to allow for greater use and dissemination of the 
  model. 
  The model is based on information about fish timing, dam operations from a 
  hydrological model (**ResSim, developed by ...**), and estimates of dam passage 
  efficiency and survival from field studies. It estimates how the distribution
  of flow through a dam's outlets routes fish through various outlets in a dam,
  including spillways, turbines, regulating outlets, and a variety of types of 
  fish passage structures. Calculations are performed for each day within a 
  hydrological period of record defined in ResSim. 
  Results from FBW include estimated dam passage efficiency (the proportion of
  fish expected to successfully pass a dam if they are attempting passage), 
  distribution of fish through available routes through the dam, and passage 
  survival through each route.
