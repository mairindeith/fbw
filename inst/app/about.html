<h2 class="title toc-ignore">What is the fbwR model?</h2>
<p><code>fbwR</code> is an R-based version of the <strong>Fish Benefits
Workbook</strong>, a modelling approach to integrating hydrology and
fish behavior to predict the passage efficiency and survival of fish as
they pass downstream of dams. It considers the movement of fish as they
pass from the forebay of a dam to its tailrace, accounting for which
routes fish can take through the dam at time of passage, and the
relative survival of passage through those routes.</p>
<p>To simulate downstream passage of fish, especially fish that migrate
with the flow of water during seaward migration, it is useful to build a
model that incorporates two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Hydrology</strong>: the position and velocity of water
passing through a dam.</li>
<li><strong>Responses to hydrology</strong>: how hydrological influences
will impact where and how well fish can approach, enter, and
successfully pass the dam.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>fbwR</code> combines these in a way that allows for modellers
and decision makers to assess changes to dam operations (including, for
example, the distribution of flow through a dam, timing of flow
operations, and reservoir elevation) and changes to dam structures
(including the building of fish passage structures).</p>

<h3>Data requirements</h3>
<p>fbwR requires two types of inputs: hydrological conditions at the dams, and parameters describing how fish respond to hydrology.</p>
<div id="step1-ressim" class="section level2"></div>
<h4>Step 1: Upload results of a ResSim hydrological simulation model</h4>
<p>The first step is to upload HEC-ResSim files (in the form of .xlsx or .xlsm) to the app. Looking at the top panel of the application, click on the "Hydrology inputs" tab.</p>
<p>There, you will see three panels: a light blue panel including helptext, and two dark blue panels where you specify how to read in the ResSim file. Click the light blue helptext box on this tab for full details on the required data format for ResSim simulation model results and how to upload the required data.</p> 
<p>After uploading the files, the app will ask you to verify which sheets in the workbook contain the required types of hydrological information (e.g., which sheet includes pool elevation, which one includes total outflow, etc.). Clicking on the "Next (compiles ResSim)" button takes you to a preview page, where you can see the uploaded and compiled ResSim hydrological variables for each day in the period of record.</p>

<div id="step2-biological" class="section level2"></div>
<h4>Step 2: Upload fish passage and dam operation parameters</h4>
<p>After uploading hydrological information, you can then upload details of dam operation and fish responses to hydrology.</p>
<p>Click on the tab labelled "Fish passage parameters" to see the four steps of this process: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li><strong>Upload parameters from a template</strong>: On this tab, you can upload a pre-filled parameter template and download your input parameters as an Excel file that matches the template format. You can also download a blank template to save to your computer and fill in manually outside of the Shiny app.<br><br><i>If you do not have a parameter template, or want to adjust the parameters you entered, go on to fill in the parameters in three steps:</i></li>
  <li><strong>Step 1. Dam passage/outlet settings</strong>: Here, enter parameters about how the dam is operated. This includes which dam outlets to simulate, whether a fish passage structure should be simulated, the operational limits of those outlets (e.g., pool elevations where they can pass flow), and outlet attractiveness. For full details, see the </li>
  <li><strong>Step 2. Monthly run timing and dam passage efficiency</strong>: </li>
  <li><strong>Step 3. Passage survival</strong>:</li>
