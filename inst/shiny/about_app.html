<!-- <h2 id="overview">Parameter Builder Shiny App</h2> -->
<p>This is a graphical front-end to a dam passage model, the Fish Benefits Workbook. This app allows users to upload or manually enter hydrological and dam passage parameters needed to run the fbwR simulation. You can run the entire model using this Shiny app, or you can use this app to create a parameter template, download it, and run fbwR simulations locally.</p>
<h3 id="load-ressim">Step 1: Load ResSim</h3>
<p>First, hydrological information is needed to direct fish through the dam for each day in a historical period of record. FBW was designed to read information from HEC-ResSim, a hydrological reservoir simulation model that projects in each day over a 40+ year period several key hydrological parameters. The information required by FBW include daily projected pool elevation (feet), total outflow (cfs), flow through the powerhouse (cfs), flow through the spillway (cfs), and flow through any regulating outlets (cfs). If any of these structures are missing in a given dam, flow is set to zero for all days in the period of record.</p>
<p>The first step is to upload HEC-ResSim files (in the form of .xlsx or .xlsm) to the app. Click on the "Load ResSim" tab on the left.</p> 
<p>After uploading, the app will ask you to verify which sheets in the workbook contain the required information, and will display some graphical representations of the uploaded hydrological information.</p>
